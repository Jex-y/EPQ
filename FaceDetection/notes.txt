Working Title: Exploring the implementation and ethical consequenses of facial recgnition.
Aim is to first build a facial recognition system and then find ways to get around it. 
Official Yolov4 is  https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet but using https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite as it uses tensorflow that I already know. 
It also supports tflite meaning that it can be used for edge computing such as phones and SOCs.

Workflow for final image should be preprocess -> face detection -> face recognition
Most of it should be done in notebooks as it can be easily presented.
